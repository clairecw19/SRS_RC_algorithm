# SRS_RC_algorithm

Summer Research Scholar Program - Reservoir Computing and Dynamical Systems II

• Aimed to investigate how the Reservoir Computing algorithm predicts the upcoming trajectory in the same orbit or even
other orbits by learning the trajectory of the motion in Hamiltonian dynamical systems

• Researched on papers related to RC algorithms and replicated the algorithms through Python programming

• Incorporated the method of interpolation into the existing RC algorithm, increasing the number of parameters that could be
entered into the original algorithm, thus expanding the number and range of orbits that can be predicted by the RC
